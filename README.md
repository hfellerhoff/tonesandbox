## What is Tone Sandbox?

Tone Sandbox is a collection of open-source interesting, useful, or fun individual musical experiences. The site is designed to allow for anyone to contribute to an existing app or create the own, with goals to provide helpful pre-built functionality to help creative coders focus on what they want to build instead of wrestling with Web Audio APIs and other musical overhead.

## What have you built so far?

- [Piano](www.tonesandbox.com/piano): Play the piano with either your mouse or a MIDI device. Choose from a variety of instruments, and customize them to suit your needs.
- [Fast-Fourier Transform](www.tonesandbox.com/fft): Visualize the sound from your microphone in real-time. Adjust the sample size or adjust the display scale to better suit your needs.
- [Sequencer](www.tonesandbox.com/sequencer): Make music with a customizable music sequencer and share it with your friends! Change measure/beat/subdivision lengths, choose your instrument, create short and held notes, and much more.

## What is pre-built to help me make music?

- Instruments: pick from a variety of preset instruments, and customize their parameters to suit your needs.
- MIDI: take in the MIDI input from a connected MIDI controller
